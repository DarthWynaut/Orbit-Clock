## About Orbit Clock

Orbit Clock is a Bootstrap web app recreation of the "Simply" Rainmeter clock widget created by DD-921. While the original widget was designed for the Rainmeter platform and included weather and music functionalities, Orbit Clock focuses on bringing its minimalist aesthetic and core timekeeping functionality to the web.

The original "Simply" widget was taken down from DeviantArt, but can still be acessed on Internet Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20201114044849/https://www.deviantart.com/dd-921/art/Rainmeter-Simply-1-0-719897850, as well as DD-921's profile: https://web.archive.org/web/20201117151224/https://www.deviantart.com/dd-921.
